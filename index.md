My name is **James Cole**. I am a UCSD transfer student at *Marshall College*. I am majoring in Computer Science.
I do not have a particular field that I am heavily invested in but I generally want to make a positive contribution
to the world through the use of technology. My favorite programming language is [C++](https://cplusplus.com/) because it is the one I am the most familiar with.
I have used Git before but am not super comfortable with the intricacies of commands like `git commit` or `git add`.
